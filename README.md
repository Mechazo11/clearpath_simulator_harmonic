# Project TODO

* [x] Find a suitable ackermann drive mars rover model: (ros2_rover)

* [x] Find a ROS 2 compliant skid-steering model for Clearpath Husky.

* [ ] Do a one run review of the MPPI-Generic algorithm to determine how to create a wrapper for it.

* [ ] Test and update clearpath's extra testing env to be compatible with Gazebo Harmonic (Gazebo 8). Start creating ```project.repos```

* [ ] Understand how to put the skid-steering kinematics model for a 4 wheel robot 

* [ ] Start a separate repo for a ROS 2 wrapper for MPPI-Generic. Figure out if we can create a node to run the cartpole example correctly.

* [ ] Start a repo for running the project, track it directly within the workspace
